  #     Hired to improve the process problems plaguing the engineering department. I trained and mentored engineers and worked with different stakeholders to begin the shift to self-managed, organically created teams and processes. My team worked on migrating legacy systems to a modern stack with a high level of quality and performance, while gathering metrics to demonstrate the benefits of modern development styles and principles on speed and quality of development.

      Built and maintained the .NET Contrast Agent. Used skills include low-level IL manipulation and generation, low-level analysis of hot paths to optimize for low latency GC, low-level internals of the CLR and CoreCLR, for both .NET Framework (3.5-4.8) and .NET (Core 2.1-3.1, 6, 7), reverse engineering of .NET assemblies for evaluation of possible vulnerable paths and low-level IL hooks.

      Architected and helped implement automatic injection of .NET/Java/NodeJS/PHP agents into existing Kubernetes workloads with a Kubernetes operator. The operator was designed to operate in large Kubernetes of over 10,000 pods though the use of techniques such as back pressure control, event stream compression, etc. This Kubernetes operator is now [Open Source](https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/agent-operator).

      Architected and helped implement a telemetry aggregation and error reporting service. The entirety of this service was designed, implemented, and deployed by the .NET agent team - including concerns such as high availability, horizontal scaling, infrastructure security, abuse detection and mitigation, time series based reporting, etc.
